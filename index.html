            <div class="id2"><b>Face and Eye Movement Tracking</b><br><br>
                <div>Face and eye movement tracking is a technology that captures and analyzes the position and movement of facial features, including eyes, using cameras and sensors. It often relies on computer vision and machine learning to interpret these movements in real-time. Applications include emotion recognition, attention analysis, and human-computer interaction. Commonly used in areas like gaming, virtual reality, and assistive technologies, it enhances user experience and accessibility. Advanced systems can even detect subtle changes, such as gaze direction or pupil dilation, for deeper insights.</div>
